Chitti Chatbot is a retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) application which utilizes a Mistral Large Language Model (LLM) for generation and a bge-m3 model developed by BAAI for retrieval. The application is built using:
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/langchain), an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), an open-source python package to build a user interface for the chatbot. I started with Streamlit, but I later shifted to Gradio as it seems to be more popular nowadays.
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), a community and platform focused on field of AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Used to access open-source LLM models and host the chatbot.
